> The Feed Barber is a feed proxy that can trim up, shape up, condition, and
> pretty up your unkept feeds.

# Overview

## What is it?

- **The Feed Barber** is self-hostable rss proxy that can change rss feeds on
  the fly, give them a trim, add some body, and much more based on what you
  setup.

## What Problems Does This Solve?

- Have you ever found an awesome site, but they are too inlove with their ads to
  give you the full content in the rss feed? The Feed Barber can trim that up.
- Have you ever wished you could rank a feed based on data in the feed itself?
  The Feed Barber can trim that up.
- Have you ever wished you could convert things into a feed that dont have a
  feed? The Feed Barber can trim that up.
- Ever wished you could remove ads from a feed. The Feed Barber can trim those
  too.
- And many other ailments...

## NON-GOALs

- Unless you enjoy reading XML, this is not the best way to
  collect/aggregate/read an cured/enhanced feed. This IS a way to make the
  content that shows up in your existing feed reader - BETTER

## Usage

So you found an unkept feed with terrible bangs, or worse a bald feed.... geez
there's a plague of them out there. Your next steps are to:

1. Choose an Enhancement.
2. Setup the Enhancement.
3. Subscribe the unkept feed through, your new Enhancement.

You then subscribe to the proxied-url like these exmaples:

- `https://thefeedBarber.com/{{userID}}/rss/{{enhance1_ID}}/somesite.com/feed.xml`
- `https://thefeedBarber.com/{{userID}}/atom/{{enhance2_ID}}/anemicsite.com/atom.xml`

## Finding Enhancements

### Selling Enhancements

List your Enhancement for sale:

- explain what it does
- give exmaple sites where it works as intentded
- give a before/after picture of the feed in a reader application
- list the price - or list as publically available
- listing versions as public is a one-way door or an irrersible process

### Buying and Setting up Enhancements

- browse the shelves of Enhancements for ugly pages
- some are general purpose
- some are highly specific
- Buy $10 of credits and spend your credits.
- With a Cure available to your account, configure the cure for your site and
  ensure you see the results desired.
- Save the configured-cure
- subscribe to the proxied-feed

### Composing an Enhancement

[See `Enhancement` on the Wiki](//github.com/ericdmoore/feedDoctor/wiki/enhancements)

- You can use other 'Enhancements' within your own
- You can use 'Enhancements' that you have purchased, as well as public
  'Enhancements'
- So its possible to have a cure that is merely a novel composition of other
  cures.
- If you were to list your 'Enhancements' "for sale", then dependent
  'Enhancements' get a percentages of your list price

### Software Library Support

After watching how package and modules, permitting unlimited dependency trees
(im looking at your npm) eventually fail to create a monetization path for those
that maintain crucial elements of plugin support, it is the strong opinion of
`feedbarber` that anything sold within the ecosystem should support the
underlying software libraries.
